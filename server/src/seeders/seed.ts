At first, she thought it was just a stomach bug and tried to tough it out, but the pain only got worse. Finally, her husband convinced her to seek medical attention. When she arrived at the hospital, Linda was seen by a gastroenterologist who suspected that she might have a peptic ulcer. After some tests, the doctor confirmed that Linda did indeed have an ulcer, and that it had caused gastrointestinal bleeding. Linda was admitted to the hospital and given medication to help control the bleeding and reduce the inflammation in her stomach. She was also advised to make some lifestyle changes, such as avoiding spicy and acidic foods, and reducing her stress levels. After three days in the hospital, Linda's condition had improved significantly. She was discharged with a prescription for medication to continue treating her ulcer, and advised to follow up with her gastroenterologist regularly. Although Linda was initially scared and reluctant to seek medical attention, she was grateful to the hospital staff for their kindness and expertise in helping her recover from her illness.

She had been working long hours and handling an increased workload due to the recent surge in patients with COVID-19. Despite the added stress, Sarah remained calm and composed, always putting her patients' needs first.One of Sarah's patients, a young girl named Emily, was admitted to the hospital with a serious illness. Emily was scared and anxious, but Sarah took the time to sit with her, answer her questions, and comfort her. Sarah went out of her way to make sure Emily felt safe and cared for, and the girl's parents were incredibly grateful for Sarah's kindness. But it wasn't just Sarah's bedside manner that earned her the Employee of the Month award. She also played a key role in training new nurses, helping to ensure that the hospital's high standards of patient care were upheld. And despite her busy schedule, Sarah always found time to help her colleagues and lend a listening ear when they needed it. Overall, Sarah's commitment to her patients, her colleagues, and the hospital as a whole made her an obvious choice for Employee of the Month. Her hard work and dedication are a true inspiration to everyone around her, and the hospital is lucky to have her on their team.",
